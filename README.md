# TDD Kata

A **Kata** in programming is a small, structured exercise designed to help developers practice a specific skill, similar to how martial artists practice movements repeatedly to improve their technique.

A **TDD Kata** is a coding exercise specifically designed to help developers practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. It follows the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test (because no code exists yet).
2. **Green**: Write just enough code to pass the test.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and improve the code while keeping all tests passing.

## Why Do a TDD Kata?

✅ Helps develop a **TDD mindset**.  
✅ Improves ability to **write clean, testable code**.  
✅ Builds muscle memory for writing **small, incremental tests**.  
✅ Encourages **refactoring and improving code structure**.  
✅ Prepares developers for **real-world TDD workflows**. 

> **TDD isn't just about writing tests; it's about writing code that is testable and, therefore, more robust and easier to maintain.**
